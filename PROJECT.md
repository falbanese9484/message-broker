# Distributed Task Queue System

## Project Overview
A distributed task processing system similar to Celery, focusing on concurrent task execution, scheduling, and monitoring across distributed workers.

---

## Core Features

### Task Management
- Task creation and scheduling  
- Priority queues  
- Task status tracking  
- Dead letter queues for failed tasks  
- Task timeouts and cancellation  

### Worker System
- Distributed worker pools  
- Worker health monitoring  
- Automatic worker recovery  
- Load balancing  
- Resource usage limits  

### Client Features
- Simple client library  
- Task result retrieval  
- Progress tracking  
- Real-time status updates  
- Batch task operations  

---

## Technical Components
- Message broker integration (Redis/RabbitMQ)  
- Distributed locking  
- Leader election  
- Health checking system  
- Metrics and monitoring  
- Task persistence

## Learning Opportunities

### Distributed Systems
- Message queues and message passing patterns  
- Distributed coordination and consensus  
- Fault tolerance and recovery strategies  
- Load balancing and scaling techniques  

### Go Programming Concepts
- Channels and goroutines for concurrency  
- Context management for cancellation  
- Interface design and implementation  
- Advanced error handling patterns  

### System Design
- Scalability considerations and bottlenecks  
- Failure modes and recovery  
- Monitoring and observability  
- Performance optimization techniques

## Development Approach
Start with a minimal viable implementation featuring an in-memory queue and single worker. Gradually expand functionality to include distributed features, persistence, monitoring, and advanced task management. This incremental approach allows for better understanding of each component before adding complexity.

---

## Future Enhancements
- Task dependencies and workflows  
- Web interface for monitoring  
- Plugin system for task handlers  
- Advanced retry strategies  
- Task routing based on tags  
- Resource quotas and rate limiting  
- Distributed tracing integration
